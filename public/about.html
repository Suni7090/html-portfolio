<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have started my journey in web development by creating a simple HTML website.
This project is helping me understand the basics of how websites actually work.
To keep track of my learning, I am uploading the website on GitHub.</p>

<p>This also gives me a platform to share my work and improve step by step.
I am deeply interested in coding and love exploring new technologies.
My goal is to grow as a web developer and build creative projects in the future.</p>
